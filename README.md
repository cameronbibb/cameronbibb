👋 ## Hello there, I'm Cameron

I am a full stack software engineer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Ruby, PostgreSQL, and React.

Most recently, I created **[Willow](https://willow-cdc.github.io/)**, an open-source framework for creating change data capture pipelines.

🤓 [You can learn more about it here →](https://willow-cdc.github.io/).

🧑‍💻 [Or visit my personal website →](https://cameronbibb.com/).

I feel seen when people join in Monty Python quotes and references with me.

When I'm not at the computer, I enjoy hiking 🥾, playing music 🎸, and time with my kids ❤.
